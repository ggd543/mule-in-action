Mule Exception Strategy Demos
---------------------------------

Start these examples with the script that is relevant for your OS.

Look at the functional test cases in src/test to see how the MuleClient can be
used to interact with the examples.  This will allow you to generate messages
that cause the services to throw exceptions and subsequently consume the
messages off the error channel.
