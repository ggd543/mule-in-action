Mule Routing Demos
---------------------------------

You must first install the common jars for these examples by running: 

mvn clean install

Each example in this chapter includes a FunctionalTestCase in src/test/.
Refer to these to see how to use the MuleClient to interact with each
programmatically (see Chapter 13 for more information about the MuleClient.)
For the examples that use JMS you are encouraged to setup an external JMS
broker and use HermesJMS to interact with the examples.
