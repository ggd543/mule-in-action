Mule JDBC Transport Demos
---------------------------------

The examples use an embedded Apache Derby database and ActiveMQ instance.
You'll need to edit the global properties and dataSource as appropriate to use
your own servers.  A MySQL schema is in src/main/sql.

You'll also need to edit the IMAP host properties using the global-properties for
each example to point to a valid IMAP server (the unit tests use a mock IMAP
server.)

Start the examples with the script that is relevant for your OS.
