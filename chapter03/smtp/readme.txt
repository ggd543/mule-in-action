Mule SMTP Transport Demos
---------------------------------

You'll need to edit the SMTP host properties using the global-properties for
each example to point to a valid SMTP server (the unit tests use a mock SMTP
server.)

Data placed ./data/invoices will be sent using the SMTP server.

Start the example with the script that is relevant for your OS.
